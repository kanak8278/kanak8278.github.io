We hosted a fantastic tutorial on Knowledge-infused Deep Learning (KiDL) at the 31st ACM Hypertext Conference on July 15. Broadly, the tutorial covered many exciting applications of Knowledge Graph in Education, Healthcare, Pandemic
We theorized the concept of  Knowledge-infusion and showed its importance in gaining explainability and spectacular performance gains. We extended the idea of KiDL to Autonomous Driving, Cyber Social Harms, and DarkWeb.
