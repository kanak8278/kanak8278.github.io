Excited to collaborate with [Kaushik Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaushik-roy-b8a323ab), [Qi Zhang](https://qizhg.github.io/), and [Amit Sheth](http://amit.aiisc.ai/) on Knowledge Graph Conference Tutorial on _Knowledge-infused Reinforcement Learning_

**Abstract**


This tutorial seeks to showcase AI strategies that provide medical context to patient data with the help of a knowledge graph. This supports personalization through a personalized knowledge graph that captures the patientâ€™s personalized health management objectives within the context of the clinical guidelines and care plan. The continuous capture of this information through the analysis of patient-VHA interactions, and the strategy of creating engaging interactions (conversations) can further augment the personalized knowledge graph. These operations are required to support self-appraisal and self-management, and when necessary perform fail-safe tasks such as connecting the patient to a crisis help-line or professional help. The core innovation is the use of a novel knowledge-infused reinforcement learning method. The by-product of this approach leads to transparency in decision-making with the ability to offer a user understandable explanation.
