**Super Excited** to share news on the acceptance of two research ideas:
* Matching Support Seekers with Support Providers
    - An **automated** method to identify *supportive users* is challenging due to *diverse roles* of users, but it is *more challenging* to #associate them with #supportseekers for *suitable help*.  
    - *Annotating* such matches is exceptionally *time consuming for experts* and #moderators on online platforms. We demonstrate an **expert validated** methodology that uses #diverseknowledge to *match support seekers and support providers*.
    - **7.2 out of 10** confidence ratings from subject matter expert and users of *Reddit* for support
    - We tested our strategy on **25000 users** from *Coronavirus and covid19_support* community pairs on *Reddit* who express *anxiety* and *depression* with *certainty*.

* Knowledge Infused Policy Gradients with Upper Confidence Bound for Relational Bandits
    - *Knowledge Infusion* in the *Relational Bandits* learning setting.
    - Deriving a Upper Confidence Bound style strategy for effective *explore-exploit trade-off*.
    - Performing *regret analysis* of our approach when we include human expertise and extensive experimentation on several benchmarking datasets.
