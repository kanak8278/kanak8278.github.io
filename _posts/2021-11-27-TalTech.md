excerpt: Invited talk at TalTech

I delivered an invited lecture on [``Personalized Bookkeeping through KnowledgeInfusedLearning (KiL)''](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JGdik_LI5JMItVHuMycxm55ogmzhwQ6CNlB6RwdPMfk/edit?usp=sharing) at [TalTech](https://taltech.ee/en) â€“ Tallinn University of Technology. It was a wonderful experience interacting with the students and people in Fintech. The talk serves as a **Tutorial** on an exciting new application of **KiL** in building a **Personalized Coach** for **Bookkeeping**.
