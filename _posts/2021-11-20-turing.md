Excited to join efforts with researchers in Alan Turing, University of Maryland, NIH, and Bar-Ilan University on "Time-sensitive sensing of language and user-generated content". 

This research effort is supported by EPSRC-UKRI and is looking forward to study new multi-social platform datasets using methods capable of capturing changes in behavior over time. An introduction of such methods is provided in this [link](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/time-sensitive-sensing-language-and-user-generated-content). 

From November 2021 to February 2022, I will be a **Visiting Researcher** at Alan Turing Institute, UK.
