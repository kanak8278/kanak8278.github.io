ISEEQ, a joint work with [Kalpa Gunaratna](https://kalpagunaratna.github.io/), [Vijay Srinivasan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jqaSvfEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and [Hongxia Jin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hongxiajin/) will be presented at **AAAI 2022**

**Preface**:
1. We contributed to broadening the capability of Conversational Information Seeking (CIS) agents by introducing the capability of curiosity through commonsense knowledge graphs.
2. We introduced ISEEQ, a CIS system capable of providing conversational assistance by dynamically retrieving meta-information supportive in generating information-seeking questions (ISQs).
3. In contrast to clarifying or followup questions, ISQs go a step further with expanding the query context by exploring relationships between entities in the query and linked entities in a knowledge graph. Thus retrieve a diverse set of passages to address a user query adequately.
4. ISEEQ opens up future research directions in CIS by facilitating the automatic creation of large-scale datasets to develop and train improved CIS systems. Furthermore, crowd-workers can evaluate and augment such datasets rather than create them anew, thus improving dataset standards.
5. Broadly construed, through **reinforcement learning** with the reward on **conceptual flow** and **logical agreement**, ISEEQ can be trained to generate questions that are safety constrained and follow a specialized knowledge processing.
