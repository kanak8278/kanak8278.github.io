Extremely excited to share the [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08660) of our article coming live on IEEE Internet Computing. 

We have prepared slides to provide an initial overview of the paper. This is a combined efforts from [Dr. Amit Sheth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitsheth/), [Keyur Faldu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keyur-faldu-681b6633/), and [Kaushik Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaushik-roy-b8a323ab/). 

Also, I am extremely excited to [share the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTHQFzw-b4&feature=emb_logo) I delivered at a Data Science Pro Webinar Series, organized by [Sabudh Foundation India](https://sabudh.org/sabudh-data-science-pro-2020-previous-webinar/).
