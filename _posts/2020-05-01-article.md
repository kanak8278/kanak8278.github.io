In the following article, I position my understanding of personalized recommendations considering diverse, ambiguous, and sparse environmental variables at personal- and population-level.
I try to motivate the essence of homogenizing knowledge graphs with deep nets for weighing specific variables influencing decisions of stakeholders.

At broader-level, it demands, Knowledge infused Learning:
