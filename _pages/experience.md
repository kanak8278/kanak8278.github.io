1. Research Intern, Microsoft Research India
   * Period: January 2024 - Current
   * Project: Working under [Programming with Representations (PwR)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/pwr/overview/): Developed an intermediate representation layer to bridge the gap between users and Large Language Models, addressing issues like hallucination and enhancing non-technical user interactions, thereby transforming chatbot building workflows. We are working on automating the chatbot building process using Conversational Programming paradigm. 
   * Built [Jugalbandi(JB) Manager](https://jugalbandi.studio/), open-source chatbot management platform supporting multiple channels, including WhatsApp, Telegram. It handles multilingual text and voice conversations using Bhashini & Azure Speech models.
   * We have open-sourced our work on GitHub:
     * [PwR-NL2DSL](https://github.com/microsoft/PwR-NL2DSL), a tool to convert Natural Language to Domain Specific Language.
     * [PwR-Studio] (https://github.com/microsoft/PwR-Studio/)
     * [Jugalbandi Studio](https://github.com/OpenNyAI/Jugalbandi-Studio-Engine)
     * [Jugalbandi Manager](https://github.com/OpenNyAI/Jugalbandi-Manager)
  
    * Mentors: [Sriram Rajamani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sriram/), [B. Ashok](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/bash/), [Akash Lal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/akashl/), [Sameer Segal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sameersegal/)

2. Research Intern, AI Institue, University of South Carolina
    * Period: December 2022 - April 2024
    
    * [Master thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uj8zn-3BVYmetg1mKluTsJGl_0-n3UfV/view) on Knowledge Enabled Multimodal Ingredient Substitution, built knowledge graph incorporating 27K ingredients and 40K substitution pairs. Enabled precise ingredient recommendations using multimodal and constraint-based searches. Developed an LLM-based query module for the ingredient substitution knowledge graph.
    * Formulated cross-modal Recipe Retrieval and developed cooking action recognition for recipe analysis, achieving 95% Recall score leading to paper [Cook-Gen](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10394432/) at IEEE SMC’23.
    * Mentors: [Revathy Venkataramanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nwri7HkAAAAJ&hl=en) [Dr. Amit Sheth](https://amit.aiisc.ai/)
   
3. Visiting Researcher at Societal Computing, Saarland University [(SIC)](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/)
    * Period: May 2023 - Aug 2023
    * Project: Time and Multispectral Domain Satellite Image Super-Resolution
    * Conducted research in Satellite Image Superresolution, enhancing disaster analysis through high-temporal frequency & low-resolution images using GAN & Diffusion models.The work was focused on improving the spatial resolution (Planet Imagery to Maxar Imagery) using conditional generation and GANs.
    * Mentors: [Ingmar Weber](https://ingmarweber.de/), [Ferda Ofli](https://www.ferdaofli.com/)

4. Research Intern, University of Maryland, Baltimore US
    * Period: September 2022 - Mayy 2023
