## [Programming with Representations (PwR)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/pwr/overview/)
Developed at Microsoft Research, this project created an intermediate representation layer to bridge the gap between users and Large Language Models, addressing issues like hallucination and enhancing non-technical user interactions.

**Repositories**:
- [PwR-NL2DSL](https://github.com/microsoft/PwR-NL2DSL) - A tool to convert Natural Language to Domain Specific Language
- [PwR-Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/PwR-Studio/) - Studio environment for Programming with Representations
- [Jugalbandi Studio](https://github.com/OpenNyAI/Jugalbandi-Studio-Engine) - Open-source chatbot framework
- [Jugalbandi Manager](https://github.com/OpenNyAI/Jugalbandi-Manager) - Chatbot management platform

**Technologies**: Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing, Conversational AI

## [Machine Learning Algorithm Selector](https://wiki.anuket.io/display/HOME/Algo-Selector) (Linux Foundation Networking Project)
**Period:** August 2021 - October 2021

Contributed to Anuket Project at Linux Foundation Networking, developing a command-line tool for ML algorithm selection based on the use case and data type. Utilized Natural Language Processing for enhanced user response extraction.

**Technologies:** Python, Command Line, NLP, Transformers, Git/GitHub, Linux

## Cyclone Intensity Detection (Smart India Hackathon, AICTE, MHRD, India)
Selected for the India Finals in Smart India Hackathon, organized by AICTE & Ministry of Education, India. Built a Cyclone Intensity Detection Application using Deep Learning (Image Processing) under the guidance of ISRO and utilizing INSAT-3DR satellite data. Our goal was to provide error-free real-time updates to avert damage and loss.

**Technologies:** Remote Sensing, Contrastive Learning, Python, Object Detection, Classification, PyTorch

## [Heart Rate Estimator](https://github.com/cheersanimesh/Vitals/tree/master) (IEEE Mega Project)
Developed a system to remotely detect an individual's heart rate per minute from a still video of their face. Implemented Eulerian Video Magnification Algorithm initially developed by MIT CSAIL Lab to magnify subtle color changes in the face that correspond to blood flow.

**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow/Keras, SciPy, Numpy

## [Multimodal Ingredient Substitution Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/kanak8278/MISKG/)
Created as part of my Master's thesis work, this project:
- Built a knowledge graph incorporating 27K ingredients and 40K substitution pairs
- Enabled precise ingredient recommendations using multimodal and constraint-based searches
- Developed an LLM-based query module for the ingredient substitution knowledge graph

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kanak8278/MISKG/)
- [Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanakraj/multimodal-ingredient-substitution/)
- Dataset used in [UC Irvine + Stanford Health Hackathon 2024](https://www.healthunity.org/2024hackathon)

## [Cook-Gen: Recipe Analysis and Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01805)
Formulated cross-modal Recipe Retrieval and developed cooking action recognition for recipe analysis, achieving 95% Recall score leading to published paper at IEEE SMC'23.

**Technologies**: Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning
